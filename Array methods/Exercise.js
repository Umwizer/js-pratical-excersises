// Priority 4 - you probably wonâ€™t get to those
// Greatest Common Divisor
// How would you find the greatest common divisor of two numbers?
// Reverse in place
// If you have a string like "I am the good boy". How can you generate "I ma eht doog yob"? Please note that the words are in place but reversed.
// String Compression
// You are given a string containing only uppercase letters. Your task is to implement a function called compressString that compresses the string by counting the consecutive occurrences of each letter and returning a new compressed string.

// The compressed string should consist of each letter followed by its count. If a letter appears only once consecutively, you should include the count.

// Example: 
// compressString("AAAABBBCCDAA"); // should return "A4B3C2D1A2"
// compressString("XYZ"); // should return "X1Y1Z1"
